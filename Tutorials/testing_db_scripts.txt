If you need to run a test on functions that require db interaction, if a global php variable
$CONNECTIONS is not set, you will need to run the "pg_connect" command before you execute your test.
An excellent example on how to setup the test can be found in "CAT-Scheduler/Source/test/test_Dropdown_select_term.php".

Using the connection string in the example is fine for testing scripts that simply retrieve information from
the database cody set up, but if you are running queries that make modifactions to data I strongly recommend
pointing the connection to your copy of the database. Simply update the host, user, and password information
in the connection string to do so.
