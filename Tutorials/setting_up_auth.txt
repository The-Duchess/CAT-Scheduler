Apache can be have settings set outside of the main configuration directory with distributed configuration files, named ".htaccess". These configs are only applied to the base directory the file is placed in and the directories below it. Currently, two htaccess files are in place, one in

Source/Pages/.htaccess

the other in

Source/Pages/Admin/.htaccess

These two are configured to require http basic auth against these directories. The one in "Pages" will allow anyone in the configured password file to login, the Admin currently only allows user "bowzr". Because the path to the password file has to be HARDCODED and ABSOLUTE, each of you will need to configure your own password file somewhere outside of the repository (for security reasons). Your home directory will be fine.

NOTE: Because of the various operating system environments in MCECS, you will need to use a specific path for your homedir
EXAMPLE: /home/$USER/$OS/.htpasswd ($OS depends on which homedir the file is in, most likely will be "ubuntu")

There is a file

Templates/htpasswd_sample

Copy this file somewhere in your directory (simplest will be in home), rename it to ".htpasswd", and update the paths in the htaccess file in Pages to point to it.

There is a second sample file

Templates/htpasswd_admins_sample

which should be copied to the same place the other htpasswd file was copied to, and renamed to ".htpasswd_admins". Update the .htaccess file in the Pages/Admin directory to point to this second file.

If you want to add more users to either of the files, you can do so with the following command:

----------------------------------
htpasswd ~/.htpasswd moarusers
  ^          ^          ^
  |          |          |
command  path to file  new username
-----------------------------------

You will be prompted to set a password, once you do the new user will be appended to the file.

If you dont want to use a personal custom one, just point both htaccess files to fido's password files.

/home/fido/ubuntu/.htpasswd
/home/fido/ubuntu/.htpasswd_admins
