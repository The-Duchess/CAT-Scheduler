To setup your own database with the table schema we have pushed to the repository, you will
need to import the scripts into your postgres database. If you are using the CATs provided one,
you can use the information in the link below for connecting to your database.

To import the scripts, simply run the following command:
 psql -h db.cecs.pdx.edu -U $username $databasename < $schemafile.sql

If you are using the CAT provided database, the databasename is defaulted to your username
Run the command against all of the .sql files in the schema directory located in the root of
the repository
