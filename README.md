This points out that we are the owner in terms of creation o the project but the code is being licensed and provided
to the CAT, which is similar to the previous version. however this will be verified with the sponsor.

This header, like i stated before, MUST be present on all source.

Additionally you MUST add your name to the contributors list in the NOTICE.

an additional piece of notice will be present in the repo that instructs people viewing this source what the licensing
restrictions are.
